Integrates satellite data, weather stations, historical phenological series, and observations. Generates probability maps of flowering by species and by pixel. This allows directing field sampling, optimizing resources, and offering local calendars for tourism, festivals, and municipal management. Learn about the diversity of Mexican flora."
